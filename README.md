## Description

---

This is the Assessment, made as part of ORX Front-End hiring process.

This is a simple project, and this was my process: after understanding the requirements and draw layout, I choose the tech necessary: React, ESlint(standart), material UI to accelerate the building process, and styled-components for detailed components.

My file/components structure is loosely based on the atomic design by Brad Frost. My intention was to separate business logic from style components. This simplifies the logic components and improves maintenance and code reusability, is easy to change inner components without affecting the logic, or change the logic without affecting the inner components.
